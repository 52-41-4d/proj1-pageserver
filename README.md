# README #

A "getting started" project for CIS 322, software engineering 1 at University of Oregon.

### What is this repository for? ###

* The objectives of this mini-project are:
  * Initial experience with GIT workflow:  Fork the project, make and test changes locally, commit;  turn in repository URL
  * Extend a tiny web server in Python, to check understanding of basic web architecture

### What do I need?  Where will it work? ###

* Designed for Unix, mostly interoperable on Linux (Ubuntu) or MacOS.  May also work on Windows, but no promises.  Consider creating a Linux virtual machine under Windows if you have trouble there, or just work on ix. 
* You will need Python version 3.4 or higher. 
* Designed to work in "user mode" (unprivileged).  Could  fail if port selected in CONFIG.py is already in use.  

### Assignment ###
* Fork this repository to create your own repository on Github.  (Read the 'git' documentation as needed.) 
* Clone your repository onto the machine you want to work on.
* Make and test your changes
* Revise this README.md file:  Erase what is no longer relevant, 
  add identifying information, include the path to your working 
  program on ix.  For example: 
  ### Author: Lil (Nancy) McGill ###
  ### Files: ~nancym/public_html/cis399se/htbin/proj1-pageserver
      ( public_html/cis399se/htbin/ is a good place to put projects 
        for this class, because later projects will need to access 
        cgi-bin scripts there)
* Commit and push ALL your changes to github (except those not under 
  revision control; e.g., you push CONFIG.base.py but not CONFIG.py)
* Turn in the github or URL to your repository

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Maintained by Michal Young, michal@cs.uoregon.edu
* Use our Piazza group for questions. Make them public (anonymous or not as you prefer) unless you have a good reason to make them private, so that everyone benefits from answers and discussion.
